    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: August 1, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>first issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  HWN is an
      experiment inspired by 
      <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly">Debian Weekly News</a>
      and <a href="http://www.lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a>.  Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Since this is the first issue, it covers a few items more than
      one week old.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p>
      <b>Updating the Haskell Standard?</b>  This <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/7879">question
      was posed</a> on haskell-cafe and reaction was mixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Best way to assemble strings?</b>  Andy Gimblett <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/7869">inquired
      about building up strings</a>.
      The discussion covered options such as
      printf, (++), concat, and even some sample code for
      interpolation inside strings.
    </p>
      
    <p><b>FFI, Threading, and Callbacks.</b>  John Goerzen <a
        href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/7862">asked
        some questions</a> about using FFI together with threading.
        Simon Marlow has written a <a
        href="http://www.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/conc-ffi.pdf">paper</a>
        on the topic that is useful background.  Duncan Coutts
        <a
        href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/7903">described</a>
        why some GUI toolkits presently do polling.
    </p> 

    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>

    <p><b><a href="http://www.haskell.org/cabal">Cabal</a> was a hot
        topic this week.</b>  Brian Smith started a discussion about
      <a
        href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3487">conditional
        code</a>
      in Cabal.  It seems to be a common problem when porting software
        to Windows.  Duncan Couts asked about <a
        href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3487">automated
        platform building</a> of Haskell packages based on their Cabal
        descriptions.  And Simon Marlow <a href="
http://news.gmane.org/find-root.php?group=gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries&article=3513">proposed</a>
        an extension to the Cabal dependency syntax.
    </p>

    <p><b>GHC in Debian unstable.</b>  Due to a C++ transition going
      on, GHC is currently uninstallable in Debian unstable.
      If you want to use it on unstable, you can grab the libgmp3
      package from stable.  More details in Debian bug <a
      href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=319222">319222</a>.
      </p>
    
    <h2>Conferences</h2>
    <p>
      The <b>2005 Haskell Workshop</b> is coming up on September 30 in
      Tallin, Estonia.  David Roundy, author of darcs, will be a
      feature presenter this year.  More information is available from
      the
      <a href="http://www.cs.uu.nl/~daan/hw2005">conference page</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Darcs Corner</h2>
    <p><b>Darcs 1.0.4pre2 released.</b>  David Roundy
      <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/7987">announced</a>
      the availability of Darcs 1.0.4pre2.  Major updates since 1.0.3
      include reduced memory usage, and experimental support for git
      archives.
    </p>
    <p><b>darcsweb.</b>  Alberto Bertogli <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/7841">announced</a>
      darcsweb, a replcement for darcs.cgi modeled after gitweb.
    </p>
    <p><b>Darcs Success Story.</b>  Mark Stosberg wrote about a
      <a
        href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/7928">success
        using Darcs</a> for just-in-time branching.
    </p>

    <p><b>Darcs on SourceForge.</b>  Eric S. Johansson 
      <a
        href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/7899">wondered</a>
      if any SourceForge-like Darcs-friendly sites existed.  Thomas
      Zander <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/7899">suggested</a>
      simply using public web space on SourceForge itself.
    </p>

    <p><b>Centralized development with Darcs.</b>  A question was
      raised about <a
        href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/7929">using
        Darcs for centralized development</a> in a specific scenario.
      Several solutions were mentioned.  Remko Troncon linked to a
      recipe for <a
        href="http://darcs.net/DarcsWiki/HintsAndTips#head-ca5f360a0038ec704eed560a82a23a742f0b547e">centralized
        logging</a> on the Darcs wiki.  Mark Stosberg pointed out his
      article, <a
        href="http://mark.stosberg.com/Tech/darcs/cvs_switch/">Benefits
        from a real world switch from CVS to Darcs</a>, and also pointed
      out the RSS support in Darcs.

        what to do and it does it."  -- My friend upon seeing some Haskell code
