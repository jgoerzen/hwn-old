    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: November 15, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>15th issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>York Haskell Compiler.</b>  Thomas Davie <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12485">announced</a>
      the York Haskell Compiler project, which already has working
      code.  Quite a few people chimed in with questions.
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Making Haskell more open.</b>  Simon Peyton-Jones began a <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12479">long
    thread</a> with some ideas about making Haskell more open to the
    wider community.  The thread is too long to completely summarize
    here, and branched out in several directions, including a
      <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12533">discussion</a>
    of the haskell.org homepage.
    </p>

    <p><b>Haskell users survey.</b>  John Hughes <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12448">wrote</a>
    about a web-based survey about Haskell.  He is encouraging
    everyone with an interest in Haskell to participate.

    <h2>Darcs Corner</h2>
    <p><b>Darcs 1.0.4</b> was <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8706">released</a>
    this week.  There are quite a few performance improvements, a new
    posthook option, manifest feature, new "darcs put" command, more
    git support, and various bugfixes.
    </p>

    <h2>Quote of the Week</h2>
    <p><i>"Impossible things are delayed immediately.  Miracles may take
    a little longer."</i> -- Claus Reinke on haskell-cafe.</p>
    
    <h2>About Haskell Weekly News</h2>
    <p>Yes, it's late again.  But, while I am no Zaphod Beeblebrox,
    carry no towel, have no Improbability Drive, and certainly
    couldn't have come up with 42 on my own, if Douglas Adam's
    "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe" series can still be called a
    trilogy, then HWN can still be called weekly :-)
    </p>
