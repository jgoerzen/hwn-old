    <ul>
      <li><b>Haskell Communities &amp; Activities Report.</b>  Andres
      Loeh <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12261">posted</a>
      a call for contributions to the periodic report.  Anyone that's
      part of a Haskell team, has published Haskell code, written
      Haskell-related papers or books, etc. is encouraged to submit a
      short entry about their activities.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Papers from the 2005 Haskell Workship.</b>  Dimitry
    Golubovsky <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8580">noted</a>
    that papers from the workshop on the ACM site required a login to
    read.  Simon Marlow posted a free link to the papers he
    co-authored.
    </p>

    <p><b>IRC for spreading information.</b>  John Goerzen
      <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8573">wrote</a>
      about some concerns regarding using IRC for spreading
      information to the Haskell community, such as happened
      recently.  It received some discussion on #haskell.
    </p>



    <p><b>Reducing memory usage.</b>  Young Hyun began an interesting
    <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8637">thread</a>
    about tracking down mysterious cases of high RAM usage.  Several
    people made suggestions for things to try, including things that
    would be useful to others.
    </p>

    <p><b>Memoization.</b>  Gerd M <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8610">wondered</a>
    why Data.Map was slower than he expected in his program.
    </p>

    <p><b>Monad Syntax.</b>  Tom Hawkins <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8601">asked</a>
    about the syntax "| m -> s" in class declarations.  Several people
    explained that this has to do with functional dependencies, an
    extension to Haskell 98.
    </p>

    <p><b>Alternatives to hs-plugins.</b>  John Goerzen <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8592">posted</a>
    a scenario in which hs-plugins would be useful, but where concerns
    about its portability may render it inappropriate.  Nils Anders
    Danielsson replied with a link to his code that can call Hugs to
    dynamically evaluate Haskell snippets.
    </p>

    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>
    <p><b>Converting fptools to Darcs.</b>  Simon Marlow <a
    href="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user">wrote</a>
    about his ideas for converting fptools from CVS to Darcs.  Several
    people made suggestions and asked questions.
