    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: August 9, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>second issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Practical Monads.</b>  Paul Moore started a
      <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/7964">discussion</a> 
      about Monads and resources for learning about them.  Quite a few
      readers responded with suggestions.
    </p>
    <p><b>STRef vs. IORef.</b>  Srinivas Nedunuri started a
      <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/11895">discussion</a>
      by asking when to STRef and when to use IORef.  Iavor Diatchki 
      posted a helpful <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/11901">example</a>,
      and many other helpful answers were posted as well.
    </p>
    <p><b>Parsing Foreign Languages.</b>  The The
      ParsingForeignLanguagesInHaskell wiki page was the subject of a
      short <a href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3572">discussion</a> on the libraries mailing list. If you have any
      further information or would like to join or start a project to
      parse a particular language, see the <a
      href="http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/ParsingForeignLanguagesInHaskell">wiki
      page</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>

    <h2>Conferences</h2>
    
    <h2>Darcs Corner</h2>
    <p><b>Darcs in FreshMeat.</b>  David Roundy is
      <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8034">looking</a>
    for volunteers to maintain the Darcs <a
    href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/darcs/">entry</a> at
    FreshMeat.net.  It wouldn't require much time, but the ability to
    summarize changes at release time.
    </p>
    <p><b>Binary files and line endings.</b>  Phil Brooke
      <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8017">asked</a>
      how darcs handles line endings and binary files.
    </p>
    <p><b>Uniqueness of patch names.</b>  On #darcs this week, a
      discussion about the uniqueness of low-level patch names in
      darcs.  The consensus seemed to be that darcs needs an
      additional better-than-1-second component to patch names to
      eliminate a situation in which collisions can arise.
    </p>
