    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: November 1, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>13th issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Time Library 0.2.</b>  Ashley Yakeley <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3882">announced</a>
    a draft of a new time library and solicited comments.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Calls for participation</h2>
    <p><b>HCAR entries due TODAY.</b>  Andres Loeh posted a
      <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8876">reminder</a>
    that entries for the Haskell Communities and Activities Report are
    due today.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Undecidable instances.</b>  In a <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12334">thread</a>
    about the need for undecidable instances, Johannes Waldmann <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12343">suggested</a>
    the use of termination analyzers.
    </p>

    <p><b>Finding the character frequency in a string.</b>
      Jon Fairbairn started an interesting <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8869">thread</a>
      about calculating the frequency each character in a string
      occurs.
    </p>

    <p><b>FFI and modifying Haskell memory.</b>  Joel Reymont <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8834">asked</a>
    about proper FFI design for programs that read data in.
    </p>

    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>
    <p><b>GHC assembly.</b>  John Meacham <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.glasgow.user/8827">posted</a>
    an analysis of GHC's assembly output, a comparison to jhc, and
    some suggestions for improving GHC's output.

    </p>

    <p><b>Data.* collections maintenance.</b>  This large
          <a
          href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3813">thread</a>
          on the libraries list covered potential future directions
          for the Data.* libraries.
    </p>

    <h2>Quotes of the Week</h2>
    <code>
      <b>For those that adhere to learn one new language per year which 
	other languages should we learn?</b><br>
      Matz suggests io (or Haskell but he admits it makes his brain explode).<br>
      -- From RubyConf 2005 Roundtable discussion with 
      Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto, creator of Ruby.

    <h2>The Meta-FAQ</h2>
    <p><b>Q: What happened to HWN last week?</b></p>
      <p>
      A: The answer to this question really goes back to the 16th
      century and the first movements in Europe to modernize astronomy
      away from the earth-centric view.  But it wasn't really until
      Newton's time (late 17th and early 18th centuries) that we
      started to have the more advanced understanding necessary to
      begin answering this question.  Modern astronomers have been
      able to calculate the period of the earth at 86164.09053
      seconds, which is a few minutes shorter than the apparent day
      due to the earth's simultaneous orbit around the sun.
    </p>
    <p>The second part of the answer to this question dates back even
       farther to ancient Egypt.  The Egyptians used a duo-decimal
       numbering system, and found it convenient to separate each day
       into 24 equal units.  Since then, other definitions for the
       hour have come in to play, usually based on the apparent solar
       day or the time between sunrise and sunset.  These days, the
       hour is defined at 3600 seconds.
    </p>
    <p>While each day appears to consist of approximately 24 hours,
      the period of the earth really is 23 hours, 56 minutes, and
      4.09053 seconds.  (I for one am pleased to receive the extra 4
      minutes per day.)
    </p>
    <p>
      So, we can see that the problem really is that there just weren't
      enough hours in a day for your HWN editor to get the issue out
      on time last week.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: Would HWN have come out on time if you hadn't prepared a
        lengthy explanation for why it was late?</b>
    </p>
    <p>A: Good question.  You should medidate on that for awhile and
    let us know for next week's HWN.
