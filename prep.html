    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: September 20, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>eighth issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Corrections.</b>  Two typos in last week's HWN.  In the web
    applications story, "S. Alexander Jacobsen" should have been
    "S. Alexander Jacobson".  In the binary pasrser combinators story,
    "Malcolm Wallac" should have been "Malcolm Wallace".  Sorry about
    that.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>GHC 6.4.1.</b>  According to Simon Marlow's <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12158">announcement</a>,
        GHC 6.4.1 is out and is mainly a bugfix release.  No library
    APIs have changed, so code working with GHC 6.4 should continue to
    work.</li>
      <li><b>Visual Haskell 0.0.</b>  Simon Marlow <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12161">announced</a>
    Visual Haskell 0.0, a Haskell development environment for the
    Microsoft Visual Studio platform.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p><b>Autrijus Tang interviewed at perl.com.</b>  Autrijus Tang is
    a Perl hacker and developer of the first working Perl 6
    <a href="http://www.pugscode.com/">interpreter</a>, which is
    written in Haskell.  On Page 2 of an <a
    href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/09/08/autrijus-tang.html?page=2">interview</a>
    on perl.com, he explained Haskell in glowing terms to the Perl
    audience.  Favorite quote: <i>"Haskell . . . is faster than C++,
    more concise than Perl, more regular than Python, more flexible
    than Ruby, more typeful than C#, more robust than Java, and has
    absolutely nothing in common with PHP."</i>  Thanks to metaperl
    for <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/node/98">mentioning</a>
    this on the Haskell Sequence.  There was als a small <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8288">thread</a>
    about this.
    </p>

    <p><b>Overloading (==).</b>  In an interesting <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8346">thread</a>,
    Tom Hawkins asked if it was possible to overload (==) to return
    something other than a Bool.  The answer was no, but the
    discussion led to comments about using typeclasses instead of a
    simple Bool type in certain situations.
    </p>

    <p><b>Haskell vs. Lisp.</b>  This <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8309">discussion</a>
    began with a post from Mark Carter, who is considering Haskell and
    wondering what advantages it might have over Lisp.  Many
    perspectives were discussed, especially relating to
    metaprogramming (Lisp macros and Template Haskell).  David
    F. Place had an interesting <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8342">post</a>.
    As someone with experience with both Haskell and Lisp, he
    commented that Haskell's "lazy evaluation eliminates 99% of the
    need for macros in Lisp."  There were also posts by <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8356">Tomasz
    Zielonka</a>, <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8316">Cale
    Gibbard</a> were also insightful.
    </p>

    <p><b>Network Parsing and Parsec.</b>  John Goerzen posed a <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8293">question</a>
    about using Parsec to parse network streams such as IMAP, where
    the results of the parsing itself determine how much data should
    be read, and reading too much data results in deadlock.  Some
    solutions offered included a separate tokenizer phase and the use
    of the Parsec state to help.
    </p>

    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>
    <p><b>The Big News</b> this week is, of course, the new release of
      GHC.  A big thanks to everyone on the GHC team for this.</p>

    <p><b>Cabal du jour.</b>  Cabal keeps coming up on the libraries
    list.  This week's <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3729">discussion</a>
    revolves around whether or not a --package-db option is wise.
    </p>

    <h2>Quotes of the Week</h2>

    <i>"Learning Haskell requires some brain rewiring, so the best way
    to learn it is by coding something in it for real. Yuval, a fellow
    "lambdacamel," learned Haskell from scratch by coding up a Forth
    parser, interpreter, and runtime all within a few days."</i> --
    Autrijus Tang
