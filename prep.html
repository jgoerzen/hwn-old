    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: October 18, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>12th issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Decimal arithmetic library.</b>  Jeremy Shaw <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8734">announced</a>
    the "premature release" of his new Decimal arithmetic library,
    which is designed for cases where binary floating point is not
    acceptable, such as money.
      </li>
      <li><b>JRegex.</b>  John Meacham <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12340">announced</a>
      JRegex, a library that interfaces to both PCRE and Posix regular
      expressions.
      </li>

      <li><b>Haskell XML Toolbox 5.3.</b>  Uwe Schmidt <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12271">announced</a>
      version 5.3 of the Haskell XML Toolbox.  The main changes in
      this release are improvements to the arrow system.
      </li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Requests for Participation</h2>
    <p><b>Future Haskell Standard.</b>  Isaac Jones <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8646">posted</a>
    a request for participation in the formation of the next
    standardized version of Haskell.
    </p>
    <p><b>HCAR Clarification.</b>  Last week's HWN story on the Haskell
    Communities & Activities Report (HCAR) had some misleading
    wording.  Participation in this report is open to all, and
    submissions are encouraged from everyone.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Haskell mentioned on Slashdot.</b> Haskell was 
      <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/10/09/1831219&tid=156">mention 
	on Slashdot</a>. The post was refering to <a 
	href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/7996">an article</a> about 
	optimizing development for fun and had <a 
	  href="http://www.pugscode.org/">pugs</a> as its example.</p>      

    <p><b>ZLib bindings.</b>  Joel Reymont <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8759">asked</a>
    about code for handling GZip files.  Henning Thielemann suggested
    the code in Darcs.  Malcom Wallace pointed out code in qforeign,
    and John Goerzen mentioned the pure-Haskell implementation in
    MissingH.
    </p>

    <p><b>GADTs.</b>  Bulat Ziganshin began a <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8708">discussion</a>
    asking for resources on GADTs.  Several people posted links to
    helpful resources.
    </p>

    <p><b>Class aliases.</b>  John Meacham began a long <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12276">discussion</a>
    by proposing class aliases, a language extension to solve problems
    of multiple implementations of the same concept in different
    libraries.
    </p>
