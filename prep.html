    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: September 20, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>eighth issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>

    <p><b>Autrijus Tang interviewed at perl.com.</b>  Autrijus Tang is
    a Perl hacker and developer of the first working Perl 6
    <a href="http://www.pugscode.com/">interpreter</a>, which is
    written in Haskell.  On Page 2 of an <a
    href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/09/08/autrijus-tang.html?page=2">interview</a>
    on perl.com, he explained Haskell in glowing terms to the Perl
    audience.  Favorite quote: <i>"Haskell . . . is faster than C++,
    more concise than Perl, more regular than Python, more flexible
    than Ruby, more typeful than C#, more robust than Java, and has
    absolutely nothing in common with PHP."</i>  Thanks to metaperl
    for <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/node/98">mentioning</a>
    this on the Haskell Sequence.
