    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: September 13, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>seventh issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>CabalFind 0.1.</b>  Dimitry Golubovsky <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8214">announced</a>
      CabalFind 0.1, an interface to search engines such as Google and

      Cairo bindings.  Some impressive screenshots are in there as
      well.
      </li>

      <li><b>OOHaskell</b>.  Ralf Laemmel and Olaf Kiselyov <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12077">announced</a>
      a new version of their paper, "Haskell's overlooked object
      system" and its accompanying library.
      </li>

      <li><b>StringMap.</b>  Adrian Hey <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12104">announced</a>

      keys to arbitrary values.
      </li>

      <li><b>AVL 2.3.</b>  Adrian Hey <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3714">announced</a>

    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Binary parser combinators.</b>  Einar Karttunen <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8256">asked</a>
    about a binary parser combinator interface for network protocol
    parsing.  Malcolm Wallac pointed out that nhc98 has a Binary
    library with a "<<" operator that could be useful.
    </p>

    <p><b>Windows programming in Haskell.</b>  Brian McQueen <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8221">asked</a>
    about Windows programming in Haskell, including access to the
    Windows registry, APIs, and communicating with other Windows
    apps.  Several suggestions relating to Hugs were offered,
    including .NET support and some libraries.
    </p>

    <p><b>Functional vs. Imperative.</b>  Dhaemon began an <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8254">interesting
    discussion</a> by asking for some help understanding functional
    vs. imperative approaches.  Several people commented on the IO
    monad, and how it is still a functional interface even though it
    may appear imperative at first glance.
    </p>

    <p><b>Mixing monadic and non-monadic functions.</b>  A long <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12077">thread</a>
    on this subject appeared in the Haskell list this week.  Rather
    too long to summarize here -- take a look at the link.
    </p>

    <p><b>

    <p><b>Language workbenches.</b> Yoel Jacobsen <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8227">wrote</a>
    about an article on language workbenches, in which configuration
    files are actually valid code in a general-purpose language.  Yoel
    went on to ask about doing this in Haskell.  Some suggestions,
    such as hs-plugins, were offered.
    </p>

    <p><b>Types in Template Haskell.</b>  Gracjan Polak <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8235">posted</a>
    about some trouble with typing in Template Haskell.  Several
    responses regarding quoting types were posted, including a
    reference to Simon Marlow's "update"
      <a
    href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/tmp/notes2.ps">paper</a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Web applications.</b>  Gary began a large <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8215">discussion</a>
    by asking about writing Web applications.  Several options were
    mentioned, including Wash and HAppS.  S. Alexander Jacobsen <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8242">mentioned</a>
    that he will be launching a commercial chat service using Haskell
    and AJAX with HAppS as the underlying core.
