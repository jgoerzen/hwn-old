    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: September 13, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>seventh issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to

        Sequence</a>.

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Why is HWN a day late this week?</b>  Your HWN editor was
    stuck in some large airports that had a <a
    href="http://changelog.complete.org/node/388">surprising lack of
    Wifi</a>.  Sigh.
    </p>

    <p><b>Binary parser combinators.</b>  Einar Karttunen <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8256">asked</a>
    about a binary parser combinator interface for network protocol
    parsing.  Malcolm Wallac pointed out that nhc98 has a Binary
    library with a "<<" operator that could be useful.
    </p>

    <p><b>Windows programming in Haskell.</b>  Brian McQueen <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8221">asked</a>
    about Windows programming in Haskell, including access to the
    Windows registry, APIs, and communicating with other Windows
    apps.  Several suggestions relating to Hugs were offered,
    including .NET support and some libraries.
    </p>

    <p><b>Functional vs. Imperative.</b>  Dhaemon began an <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8254">interesting
    discussion</a> by asking for some help understanding functional
    vs. imperative approaches.  Several people commented on the IO
    monad, and how it is still a functional interface even though it
    may appear imperative at first glance.
    </p>

    <p><b>Mixing monadic and non-monadic functions.</b>  A long <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12077">thread</a>
    on this subject appeared in the Haskell list this week.  Rather
    too long to summarize here -- take a look at the link.
    </p>

    <p><b>Language workbenches.</b> Yoel Jacobsen <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8227">wrote</a>
    about an article on language workbenches, in which configuration
    files are actually valid code in a general-purpose language.  Yoel
    went on to ask about doing this in Haskell.  Some suggestions,
    such as hs-plugins, were offered.
    </p>

    <p><b>Types in Template Haskell.</b>  Gracjan Polak <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8235">posted</a>
    about some trouble with typing in Template Haskell.  Several
    responses regarding quoting types were posted, including a
    reference to Simon Marlow's "update"
      <a
    href="http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/tmp/notes2.ps">paper</a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Web applications.</b>  Gary began a large <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8215">discussion</a>
    by asking about writing Web applications.  Several options were
    mentioned, including Wash and HAppS.  S. Alexander Jacobsen <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8242">mentioned</a>
    that he will be launching a commercial chat service using Haskell
    and AJAX with HAppS as the underlying core.
    </p>

    <p><b>Calling Haskell from C++.</b>  Felix Breuer <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.glasgow.user/8652">wrote</a>
    about some trouble calling into Haskell from C++ programs.
    Several suggestions were provided, mostly relating to C++ name
    mangling.
    </p>

    <p><b>What gets profiled?</b>  Niels began a <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.glasgow.user/8622">discussion</a>
    on the use of profiling features by commenting that profiling
    didn't seem to show the problem in his own code.  Several
    suggestions regarding memory use and possible reasons that
    profilers might miss things were provided.
    </p>

    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>

    <p><b>GHC 6.4.1.</b>  Simon Marlow posted an <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.glasgow.user/8649">update</a>
    on GHC 6.4.1.  Though more bug reports have been rolling in while
    he was away, only a few are blockers for 6.4.1.  The tentative
    release date is September 19.
    </p>

    <p><b>Data.Monoid.</b>  Ross Paterson <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3719">proposed</a>
    replacing an instance of Data.Monoid.  There was some discussion
    about whether the old or new instance was better.
    </p>

    <h2>Quotes of the Week</h2>

    <xmp>
<poetix> "Oh, a monad...that's just a funny name for a particular
         sort of arrow"
<mcnster> Chocolate Frosted Monads, new from Cadbury
<mcnster> ... "All the sugar, twice the arrows"
<mcnster> Mr. Tweedsmuir, we're going to have to bypass your left
          ventrical monad. You'll probably never play Chopin again
<poetix> Readers of the ABC Warriors strip in 2000AD may remember The
         Monad as the concentrated essence of human evil
<mcnster> Monadocet. Because category theory should be understood by everyone.
    </xmp>
