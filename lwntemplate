From Forrest Cook at LWN:

You can email announcements of the newsletter to lwn@lwn.net,
here's the format I have used:

The August 2, 2005 edition of the
<a href="http://sequence.complete.org/hwn/20050802">Haskell Weekly News</a>
is online with the latest Haskell language articles.
"<span>HWN is an experiment inspired by Debian Weekly News  and Linux
Weekly News. Each Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to the
Haskell mailing list and (as HTML) to The Haskell Sequence.</span>"

E-mail allouncements to lwn@lwn.net

jgoerzen will normally do this each week
