                      Haskell Weekly News: October 4, 2005

   Greetings, and thanks for reading the 10th issue of HWN, a weekly
   newsletter for the Haskell community. Each Tuesday, new editions will be
   posted (as text) to [1]the Haskell mailing list and (as HTML) to [2]The
   Haskell Sequence.

New Releases

     The Monad.Reader, Issue 5. Shae Matijs Erisson [3]announced the release
     of the fifth issue of The Monad.Reader, the online magazine devoted to
     Haskell. Subjects in this issue include a short introduction to Haskell,
     generating polyominoes, a ray tracer, number parameterized types,
     practical graph manipulation, and a short introduction to software
     testing in Haskell. TMR is available [4]online.

Discussion

   Quiet or Busy? It's been a quiet week on the Haskell lists, so this week's
   HWN is a bit sparse. But that's because many Haskellers were at the
   Haskell workshops at ICFP in Estonia. I expect we'll see some fallout from
   those workshops on the list in the coming week.

   Haskell workshop items. Over on the IRC channel [5]logs from September 30,
   there was a live conversation beginning at 15:36:33 of the "Future of
   Haskell discussion." Autrijus Tang's journal had several pages of entries,
   including one [6]providing a nice summary.

   Endian conversion. Joel Reymont asked about converting binary data in a
   network protocol, and several suggestions were posted in the resulting
   [7]discussion.

   Is putChar strict? John Meacham [8]asked this question, and pointed out
   that different Haskell compilers/interpreters are behaving in different
   ways.
