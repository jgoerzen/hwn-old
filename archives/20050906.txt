                     Haskell Weekly News: September 6, 2005

   Greetings, and thanks for reading the sixth issue of HWN, a weekly
   newsletter for the Haskell community. Each Tuesday, new editions will be
   posted (as text) to [1]the Haskell mailing list and (as HTML) to [2]The
   Haskell Sequence.

New Releases

     * h4sh 0.2. Donald Bruce Stewart [3]announced version 0.2 of h4sh, a
       tool to expose Haskell functions to shell scripters. This release adds
       more functions, removed argument flags, cabalized the package, added
       regex operators, and had some other changes as well.
     * cabal-get/put beta. Isaac Jones [4]announced the beta of cabal-get,
       which will download and install Haskell packages and their
       dependencies. It is designed to work for any cabal-compatible package.
       The cabal-get team is looking for beta testers to try out both
       cabal-get and cabal-put.

Discussion

   Emacs haskell-mode. Frederik Eaton began a [5]thread on the Emacs
   haskell-mode, asking where the latest version is available from.

   Time limits on computations. Dmitry Vyal [6]asked how to set a time limit
   on computations. Several different suggestions were presented over the
   course of the discussion.

Haskell Toolchain

   The Haskell CVS server, previously hosted at OGI, is now being [7]hosted
   by [8]Galois. There is a new machine and updated software, but it should
   be a drop-in replacement overall.

Darcs Corner

   Darcs 1.0.4pre3 and pre4. Two new Darcs prerelease versions happened this
   week. First, 1.0.4pre3 was [9]announced this week. 1.0.4pre4 quickly
   [10]followed, correcting an error in a Makefile. This is expected to be
   the last prerelease prior to 1.0.4 itself.

Quote of the Week

   "When I read through a Haskell program, it's more like reading a novel
   than solving a calculus problem." -- [11]post on the Haskell Sequence
