    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: August 30, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>fifth issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>HWN is 1 day late this week.</b>  Pesky Real Life (TM)
      interfered.  Sorry about that.  Hopefully this won't happen
      again.  Also, anyone that wants to help edit HWN is welcome to
      do so.  See the contributing section at the end.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>FUSE bindings.</b>  David Roundy <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8110">announced</a>
      bindings for FUSE, the Linux library that lets people develop a
      filesystem using userspace code.  Isaac Jones also
        <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8125">mentioned</a>
      Jeremy Bobbio's FUSE bindings.
      </li>
      <li><b>FastPackedString (FPS) packaging.</b>  Donald Bruce
      Stewart has extraced the FastPackedString module from darcs and
        <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12003">produced</a> a standalone package.  It is useful for working with
        binary data and blocks of string data.
      </li>
      <li><b>Haskell Server Pages (HASP).</b>  Lemmih <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12002">announced</a>
      Haskell Server Pages 0.3, an infrastructure for developing
      dynamic web sites.  It's based around XML and the earlier work
      on HSP.
      <li><b>Cairo bindings for gtk2hs completed.</b>  Paolo Martini
      <a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=8063084&forum_id=44293">announced</a>
      that the Cairo bindings have been checked into the gtk2hs CVS
      repo on SourceForge.
      </li>
        
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Parsing Binary Files.</b>  Joel Reymont began an <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8111">interesting
    discussion</a>
          by asking about using Haskell to implement a parser for a
          binary poker protocol.  Erlang has some binary pattern
          matching features, and there was some discussion about
          achieving similar results in Haskell.</p>
    
    <p><b>Using STArray.</b>  Alistair Bayley asked how to use STArray
      to improve the performance of a program.  Numerous suggestions
      were offered in the ensuing <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8091">discusion</a>,
      including a link to some <a
      href="http://haskell.org/hawiki/ImperativeHaskell">examples</a>
      on the Haskell wiki.
    </p>

    <p><b>Compiling Windows GUI Executables.</b>
        Juan Carlos Arevalo Baeza <a
        href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.glasgow.user/8584">asked</a>
        about compiling Windows GUI executables with ghc.  Duncan
        Coutts posted a <a
        href="http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/archives/2005/06/23/hiding-the-console-on-windows/">link</a>
        to the Gtk2Hs FAQ explaining the procedure.
    </p>

    <h2>Quotes of the Week</h2>
<xmp>
    <xerox> <bitwize> Then Edsger Dijkstra came down from Mt. Sinai
                      with a tablet proclaiming "Thou shalt not use
                      GOTO; it is considered harmful"...
</xmp>
    <p>
    From Chad Scherror on the haskell-cafe list: <i>"I've been amazed at the level of
effort put forth by the Haskell community as a whole to help out
newcomers."
    </i>
