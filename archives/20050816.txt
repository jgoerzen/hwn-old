                      Haskell Weekly News: August 16, 2005

   Greetings, and thanks for reading the third issue of HWN, a weekly
   newsletter for the Haskell community. Each Tuesday, new editions will be
   posted (as text) to [1]the Haskell mailing list and (as HTML) to [2]The
   Haskell Sequence.

New Releases

     * gtk2hs 0.9.9. Axel Simon [3]announced the latest version of this
       binding to GTK, primarily containing bugfixes.
     * h4sh. Donald Bruce Stewart [4]announced the new Haskell for shell
       scripts package. It exposes the Haskell Data.List library for use in
       shell scripting.
     * c2hs 0.14.3. Manuel M. T. Chakravarty [5]released version 0.14.3 of
       c2hs. Improvements over 0.14.1 include support for cross-compilation,
       gcc's asm construct, better support for hierarchical module syntax,
       and new name translation functions.
     * magic-haskell. John Goerzen [6]announced the availability of
       magic-haskell, a binding to C's libmagic. With it, you can determine
       the type of a file by looking at its contents rather than its name.
     * AVL 2.2. Adrian Hey [7]released AVL 2.2. It introduces new set
       manipulation functions, a new type of zipper, and optimizations for
       functions that don't modify a tree.

Discussion

   HWN format changes this week. Based on reader feedback, the New Releases
   section has been moved to the top of HWN. Please let me know what you
   think. Before you ask, the Darcs and Quotes of the Week sections are
   missing because there was no news for them this week.

   Static typing. Minh Thu started a [8]discussion about the pros and cons of
   static typing and side effects.

   Language version pragmas. Bulat Ziganshin [9]proposed a way to specify
   what language version and options are used in Haskell sources.
