                      Haskell Weekly News: August 30, 2005

   Greetings, and thanks for reading the fifth issue of HWN, a weekly
   newsletter for the Haskell community. Each Tuesday, new editions will be
   posted (as text) to [1]the Haskell mailing list and (as HTML) to [2]The
   Haskell Sequence.

   HWN is 1 day late this week. Pesky Real Life (TM) interfered. Sorry about
   that. Hopefully this won't happen again. Also, anyone that wants to help
   edit HWN is welcome to do so. See the contributing section at the end.

New Releases

     * FUSE bindings. David Roundy [3]announced bindings for FUSE, the Linux
       library that lets people develop a filesystem using userspace code.
       Isaac Jones also [4]mentioned Jeremy Bobbio's FUSE bindings.
     * FastPackedString (FPS) packaging. Donald Bruce Stewart has extraced
       the FastPackedString module from darcs and [5]produced a standalone
       package. It is useful for working with binary data and blocks of
       string data.
     * Haskell Server Pages (HASP). Lemmih [6]announced Haskell Server Pages
       0.3, an infrastructure for developing dynamic web sites. It's based
       around XML and the earlier work on HSP.
     * Cairo bindings for gtk2hs completed. Paolo Martini [7]announced that
       the Cairo bindings have been checked into the gtk2hs CVS repo on
       SourceForge.

Discussion

   Parsing Binary Files. Joel Reymont began an [8]interesting discussion by
   asking about using Haskell to implement a parser for a binary poker
   protocol. Erlang has some binary pattern matching features, and there was
   some discussion about achieving similar results in Haskell.

   Using STArray. Alistair Bayley asked how to use STArray to improve the
   performance of a program. Numerous suggestions were offered in the ensuing
   [9]discusion, including a link to some [10]examples on the Haskell wiki.

   Compiling Windows GUI Executables. Juan Carlos Arevalo Baeza [11]asked
   about compiling Windows GUI executables with ghc. Duncan Coutts posted a
   [12]link to the Gtk2Hs FAQ explaining the procedure.

Quotes of the Week

       Then Edsger Dijkstra came down from Mt. Sinai
                       with a tablet proclaiming "Thou shalt not use
                       GOTO; it is considered harmful"...

   From Chad Scherror on the haskell-cafe list: "I've been amazed at the
   level of effort put forth by the Haskell community as a whole to help out
   newcomers."
