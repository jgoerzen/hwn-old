    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: September 27, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>ninth issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul><li><b>GHC 6.4.1 for MacOS X.</b>  Wolfgang Thaller <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12182">announced</a>
    the availability of a binary GHC 6.4.1 package for MacOS X.</li>
      <li><b>ghc-api 0.1.0.</b>  Lemmih <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12166">announced</a>

    by hIDE.</li>
      
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    
    <p><b>Haskell Team Winns ICFP!</b>  Congratulations to Wolfgang
      Thaller's team for
      winning the ICFP 2005 programming contest!  According to the <a
      href="http://icfpc.plt-scheme.org/">ICFP homepage</a>, <i>"First
      prize goes to KiebererAndXiaoTou.  The judges are happy to
      proclaim that Haskell is the programming tool of choice for
      discriminating hackers."</i>  This is the second year in a row
      in which a team using Haskell has taken first place in this contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Combat-Tanteidan team (Takayuki Muranushi and Hideyuki
      Tanaka), also using Haskell, took third place in this year's
      ICFP.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, on page 68 of the <a
      href="http://icfpc.plt-scheme.org/icfpc2005-talk.pdf">presentation
      slides</a>, you can see that Haskell was the top-performing
      language at the contest overall.  The author wrote, <i>"The
      clear fact that stands out here is that Haskell is the language
      of choice for the programming contest.  Haskell stands out a
      little bit in the first round, but it clearly stands out in the
      twist.  So, kudos to the Haskell community for both producing a
      language that lets people build re-usable code and instilling
      this as a value in their community!"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the names of all team members were not
      documented, so I was not able to list the real names for this
      story.  Thanks to Don Stewart for sending me information about this.
    </p>

    <p><b>Haskell-style proof tools.</b>  Robin Green asked about
      proof tools, and the resulting <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8451">thread</a>
    contained several suggestions.
    </p>

    <p><b>Trapped by Monads.</b>  In this <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8427">thread</a>,
    the infamous IO monad was discussed, along with a number of
    comparisons to Forth.
