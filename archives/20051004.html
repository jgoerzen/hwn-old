    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: October 4, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>10th issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul><li><b>The Monad.Reader, Issue 5.</b>  Shae Matijs Erisson <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12216">announced</a>
    the release of the fifth issue of The Monad.Reader, the online
    magazine devoted to Haskell.  Subjects in this issue include a short introduction to Haskell, generating
polyominoes, a ray tracer, number parameterized types, practical graph
manipulation, and a short introduction to software testing in Haskell.
        TMR is available <a
    href="http://www.haskell.org/tmrwiki/IssueFive">online</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Quiet or Busy?</b>  It's been a quiet week on the Haskell
      lists, so this week's HWN is a bit sparse.  But that's because
    many Haskellers were at the Haskell workshops at ICFP in Estonia.
    I expect we'll see some fallout from those workshops on the list
    in the coming week.</p>

    <p><b>Haskell workshop items.</b>  Over on the IRC channel <a
    href="http://meme.b9.com/cview.html?channel=haskell&date=050930">logs</a>
    from September 30, there was a live conversation beginning at
    15:36:33 of the "Future of Haskell discussion."  Autrijus Tang's
    journal had several pages of entries, including one <a
    href="http://use.perl.org/~autrijus/journal/26953">providing a
    nice summary</a>.
    </p> 
    
    <p><b>Endian conversion.</b>  Joel Reymont asked about converting
    binary data in a network protocol, and several suggestions were
    posted in the resulting <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8556">discussion</a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Is putChar strict?</b>  John Meacham <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12224">asked</a>
    this question, and pointed out that different Haskell
    compilers/interpreters are behaving in different ways.
    </p>
