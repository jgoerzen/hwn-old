Discussion

   Papers from the 2005 Haskell Workship. Dimitry Golubovsky [7]noted that
   papers from the workshop on the ACM site required a login to read. Simon
   Marlow posted a free link to the papers he co-authored.

   7. http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8580

   IRC for spreading information. John Goerzen [8]wrote about some concerns
   regarding using IRC for spreading information to the Haskell community,
   such as happened recently. It received some discussion on #haskell.

   Reducing memory usage. Young Hyun began an interesting [9]thread about
   tracking down mysterious cases of high RAM usage. Several people made
   suggestions for things to try, including things that would be useful to
   others.

   9. http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8637

   Memoization. Gerd M [10]wondered why Data.Map was slower than he expected
   in his program.

  10. http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8610

   Monad Syntax. Tom Hawkins [11]asked about the syntax "| m -> s" in class
   declarations. Several people explained that this has to do with functional
   dependencies, an extension to Haskell 98.

  11. http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8601

   Alternatives to hs-plugins. John Goerzen [12]posted a scenario in which
   hs-plugins would be useful, but where concerns about its portability may
   render it inappropriate. Nils Anders Danielsson replied with a link to his
   code that can call Hugs to dynamically evaluate Haskell snippets.

Haskell Toolchain

   Converting fptools to Darcs. Simon Marlow [13]wrote about his ideas for
   converting fptools from CVS to Darcs. Several people made suggestions and
   asked questions.
