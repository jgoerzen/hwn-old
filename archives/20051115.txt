                     Haskell Weekly News: November 15, 2005

   Greetings, and thanks for reading the 15th issue of HWN, a weekly
   newsletter for the Haskell community. Each Tuesday, new editions will be
   posted (as text) to [1]the Haskell mailing list and (as HTML) to [2]The
   Haskell Sequence.

New Releases

     * York Haskell Compiler. Thomas Davie [3]announced the York Haskell
       Compiler project, which already has working code. Quite a few people
       chimed in with questions.

Discussion

   Making Haskell more open. Simon Peyton-Jones began a [4]long thread with
   some ideas about making Haskell more open to the wider community. The
   thread is too long to completely summarize here, and branched out in
   several directions, including a [5]discussion of the haskell.org homepage.

   Haskell users survey. John Hughes [6]wrote about a web-based survey about
   Haskell. He is encouraging everyone with an interest in Haskell to
   participate.

Darcs Corner

   Darcs 1.0.4 was [7]released this week. There are quite a few performance
   improvements, a new posthook option, manifest feature, new "darcs put"
   command, more git support, and various bugfixes.

Quote of the Week

   "Impossible things are delayed immediately. Miracles may take a little
   longer." -- Claus Reinke on haskell-cafe.

About Haskell Weekly News

   Yes, it's late again. But, while I am no Zaphod Beeblebrox, carry no
   towel, have no Improbability Drive, and certainly couldn't have come up
   with 42 on my own, if Douglas Adam's "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe"
   series can still be called a trilogy, then HWN can still be 
   called weekly :-)

   Want to continue reading HWN? Please help us create new editions of this
   newsletter. Please see the [8]contributing information, or send stories to
   hwn -at- complete -dot- org. There is also a Darcs repository available.
