    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: September 6, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>sixth issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>h4sh 0.2.</b>  Donald Bruce Stewart 
        <a
        href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12043">announced</a>
        version 0.2 of h4sh, a tool to expose Haskell functions to
        shell scripters.  This release adds more functions, removed
        argument flags, cabalized the package, added regex operators,
        and had some other changes as well.
      </li>

      <li><b>cabal-get/put beta.</b>  Isaac Jones <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8188">announced</a>
      the beta of cabal-get, which will download and install Haskell
      packages and their dependencies.  It is designed to work for any
      cabal-compatible package.  The cabal-get team is 
        looking for beta testers to
      try out both cabal-get and cabal-put.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Emacs haskell-mode.</b>  Frederik Eaton began a
      <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12044">thread</a>
    on the Emacs haskell-mode, asking where the latest version is
    available from.
    </p>
    <p><b>Time limits on computations.</b>  Dmitry Vyal <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8185">asked</a>
      how to set a time limit on computations.  Several different
      suggestions were presented over the course of the discussion.
    </p>


    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>
    <p>The Haskell CVS server, previously hosted at OGI, is now being
      <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/12036">hosted</a>
    by <a href="http://www.galois.com/">Galois</a>.  There is a new
    machine and updated software, but it should be a drop-in
    replacement overall.
    </p>

    <h2>Darcs Corner</h2>
    <p><b>Darcs 1.0.4pre3 and pre4.</b>  Two new Darcs prerelease
    versions happened this week.  First, 1.0.4pre3 was 
    <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8192">announced</a>
    this week.  1.0.4pre4 quickly <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8198">followed</a>,
    correcting an error in a Makefile.  This is expected to be the
    last prerelease prior to 1.0.4 itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Quote of the Week</h2>
    <p>
      <i>"When I read through a Haskell program, it's more like reading
        a novel than solving a calculus problem."</i> --
