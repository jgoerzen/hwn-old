    <h1>Haskell Weekly News: August 23, 2005</h1>
    <p>Greetings, and thanks for reading the <b>fourth issue of HWN</b>, a
      weekly newsletter for the Haskell community.  
      Each
      Tuesday, new editions will be posted (as text) to
      <a href="http://www.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell">the
        Haskell mailing list</a> and (as HTML) to
      <a href="http://sequence.complete.org/">The Haskell
        Sequence</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>New Releases</h2>
    <ul><li><b>ghc-src 0.2.0.</b>  Lemmih <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/11987">announced</a>
    ghc-src.  ghc-src is a Haskell parser with full support for every
    GHC extension.  It is based on the GHC source and is meant as a
    replacement for haskell-src-exts, though it could of course have
    other ueses.  ghc-src is available via a Darcs <a href="http://scannedinavian.org/~lemmih/ghc-src/">repository</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Cairo binding.</b>  Not a formal release, but <a
          href="http://haskell.org/gtk2hs/archives/category/cairo/">great
          progress</a> is being made on the binding to the 
        <a href="http://www.cairographics.org/introduction">Cairo</a> vector
        graphics toolkit, including some working code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p><b>Category theory monads.</b>  Cale Gibbard began a <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8044">discussion</a>
    comparing the monads from category theory with the implementation
    of monads in Haskell.  Michael Vanier <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8046">suggested</a>
    some of Phil Wadler's <a
    href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/topics/monads.html">papers</a>
    on monads.  Michael went on to say that Haskell monads are very
    similar to those from category theory.
    </p>

    <p><b>More on FFI and callbacks.</b>  The <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/7862">thread</a>
    on FFI and callbacks was revived this week.  Among other things,
    Duncan Coutts <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8065">noted</a> 
      that there is no easy way to do a really correct binding to
      wxWidgets from Haskell when Haskell programs are multithreaded,
      due to limitations in Haskell's threading model.
    </p>

    <p><b>Oracle on Haskell.</b>  Brian Strand <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8032">asked</a>
    about using Oracle on Haskell, and more generally, about the
    suitability of Haskell for database programming.  Alistair Bayley <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8033">mentioned</a>
    that <a
    href="http://cvs.sf.net/viewcvs.py/haskell-libs/libs/takusen/">takusen</a>
    has Oracle support.  John Goerzen <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8041">suggested</a>
    using HSQL's ODBC support, with unixODBC on *nix platforms.  He
    went on to say that HSQL has been used in production
    environments.  Krasimir Angelov, author of HSQL, <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8042">added</a>
    that he's been wanting to add Oracle support to HSQL for awhile.
    Finally, Brian Strand later <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8047">followed
    up</a> and said that takusen has been working well for him so far.
    </p>

    <p><b>Pros and cons of static typing.</b>  Keean Schupke
      <a
      href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8020">revived</a>
      an <a
      href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.general/11950">earlier
      discussion</a> about the pros and cons of static typing and side
      effects.
    </p>

    <p><b>Static typing and interactivity.</b>  On a similar note,
    Ketil Malde <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8037">wrote</a>
    about not being able to load modules with type errors into ghci.
    Bernard Pope <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.cafe/8045">suggested</a>
    the type debugger in <a
    href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sulzmann/chameleon/">Chameleon</a>.
    </p>

    <p><b>Argument ordering.</b>  A <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3622">thread</a>
    about the order of arguments to functions entertained many
    different viewpoints this week.  Too many to really summarize
    here.
    </p>

    <p><b>Decoupling and encapsulation.</b>  Terrence Brannon <a
    href="http://sequence.complete.org/node/88">wrote</a> about
    decoupling program elements from presentation, as in HTML
    generators.  He included a link to his document describing
    architectural flaws in Perl's HTML::Mason.
    </p>

    <p><b>Future of The Monad.Reader.</b>  Shae Erisson wrote on
    #haskell today that he is looking for someone to either take over,
    or help with, editing <a
    href="http://www.haskell.org/hawiki/TheMonadReader">The
    Monad.Reader</a>, Haskell's monthly online magazine.  Anyone that
    would like to help should contact him.
    </p>

    <p><b>How is HWN material found?</b>  I've received some
      questions this week about how I find material for HWN.  The most
      obvious way is if someone sends it to me; see the link at the
      bottom of each HWN for contribution information.  Other than that,
      I read the main Haskell mailing lists, the Haskell Sequence, and
      IRC looking for things to write about.  I prefer to have stories
      linked in at least one of these places before covering them in
      HWN, since it gives readers a convenient place to follow
      discussion.

    <h2>Haskell Toolchain</h2>

    <p><b>Cabal design.</b>  Frederik Eaton started another <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3625">discussion</a>
    about Cabal, this time focusing on run time vs. configure time
    issues, the usage of custom package.conf files, and multiple cabal
    files in one package.  Isaac Jones <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3629">commented</a>
    on most of those items.  Duncan Coutts <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.libraries/3632">suggested</a>
    the ability to register a package "in place".
    </p>

    <h2>Darcs Corner</h2>
    <p><b>Colordiff.</b>  Dmitriy Morozov <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8065">asked</a>
    about using colordiff with darcs.  Timo Savola <a
    href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8066">suggested</a>
    a shell function to accomplish this.</p>

    <p><b>Linus and git.</b>  Juliusz Chroboczek <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8081">posted</a>
    a link to a discussion about Git, and mentioned that it looks like
    they're re-inventing some Darcs features.
    </p>

    <p><b>Success with trac.</b>  Pedro Melo <a
    href="http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.darcs.user/8073">posted</a>
    about his success using trac (a SourceForge-like system) with
    Darcs.
