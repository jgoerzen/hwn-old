                    Haskell Weekly News: September 27, 2005

   Greetings, and thanks for reading the ninth issue of HWN, a weekly
   newsletter for the Haskell community. Each Tuesday, new editions will be
   posted (as text) to [1]the Haskell mailing list and (as HTML) to [2]The
   Haskell Sequence.

Discussion

   Haskell Team Winns ICFP! Congratulations to Wolfgang Thaller's team for
   winning the ICFP 2005 programming contest! According to the [5]ICFP
   homepage, "First prize goes to KiebererAndXiaoTou. The judges are happy to
   proclaim that Haskell is the programming tool of choice for discriminating
   hackers." This is the second year in a row in which a team using Haskell
   has taken first place in this contest.

   The Combat-Tanteidan team (Takayuki Muranushi and Hideyuki Tanaka), also
   using Haskell, took third place in this year's ICFP.

   In addition, on page 68 of the [6]presentation slides, you can see that
   Haskell was the top-performing language at the contest overall. The author
   wrote, "The clear fact that stands out here is that Haskell is the
   language of choice for the programming contest. Haskell stands out a
   little bit in the first round, but it clearly stands out in the twist. So,
   kudos to the Haskell community for both producing a language that lets
   people build re-usable code and instilling this as a value in their
   community!"

   Unfortunately, the names of all team members were not documented, so I was
   not able to list the real names for this story. Thanks to Don Stewart for
   sending me information about this.

   Haskell-style proof tools. Robin Green asked about proof tools, and the
   resulting [7]thread contained several suggestions.

   Trapped by Monads. In this [8]thread, the infamous IO monad was discussed,
   along with a number of comparisons to Forth.
